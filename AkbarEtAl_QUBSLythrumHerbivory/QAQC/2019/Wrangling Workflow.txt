Cleaning 2019 Lythrum Field Data

## (1) Prep data for error-checking
- for each dataset (heights, damage, fitness)
-- make sure columns are the right data type
-- do a summary() to check for odd values
-- take only values not in "Missing_Plants_List.csv" (use anti_join(x,y,key="") from dplyr, takes all values from x that aren't in y)

# Height data:
- make a column "round" that says what round each set of measurements was collected in
- make a column called "ind" that is block-pos (e.g. E1-34, E6-142, E7-1,...), this will be the key connecting all data sets

# Damage data:
- make a column "dround" that says what round each set of damage measurements was collected in
- make a column called "ind" that is block-pos (e.g. E1-34, E6-142, E7-1,...), this will be the key connecting all data sets

# Fitness data:
- make a column called "ind" that is block-pos (e.g. E1-34, E6-142, E7-1,...), this will be the key connecting all data sets

# populationinfo.csv


## (2) Error-checking
# Height data:
# (A) Check for some more obvious issues
- flag all measurements (veg, bud, flw, frt, abt) > 250 cm -- these are probably mistakes
-- hard-code fix these after consulting paper datasheets in purple folder

# (B) Look for issues in measurements within rounds
Logically, measurements should follow bud>=flw>=frt>=abt>=veg.
- make function heightOK() that takes in the Data dataframe and checks if the above condition is always satisfied for each plant within each round
-- for each observation (plant during specific measurement round), make a temporary vector that stores its bud, flw, frt, abt, veg height (in that order)
-- order the elements in this vector from biggest to smallest using order()
--- it should always be that 

- export as 2019_Heights_Clean.csv

# Damage data:
- export as 2019_Damage_Clean.csv

# Fitness data:
- (temporarily) take out plants with weights < -1 (so that mean_bag_weight > total_bag_weight by more than 1)
-- these will need to be reweighed
- export as 2019_Fitness_Clean.csv


## (3) Putting it all together
- use dplyr left_join(x,y,key="") to join together populationinfo and height, populationinfo and damage, populationinfo and fitness
